# Hospital Readmission Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict hospital readmissions within 30 days of initial discharge, helping healthcare providers proactively manage patient care and optimize resource allocation.

## 🏥 Project Purpose

The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the likelihood of a patient requiring readmission, enabling:
- Early intervention strategies
- Personalized patient care planning
- Efficient healthcare resource management

## ✨ Key Features

- **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning model to forecast hospital readmission risks
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Streamlit-based application for easy prediction
- **Comprehensive Patient Data Analysis:** Considers multiple patient attributes

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Serialization:** Pickle

## 📊 Input Features

The model considers the following patient characteristics:
- Gender
- Admission Type
- Primary Diagnosis
- Number of Lab Procedures
- Number of Medications
- Outpatient Visits
- Inpatient Visits
- Emergency Visits
- Total Diagnoses
- A1C Test Results
